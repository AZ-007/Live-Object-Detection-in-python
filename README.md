# What is MobilenetSSD?

<p><bold>MobileNet-SDD is </bold> Convolutional neural networks are used to develop a model that consists of multiple layers for classifying given objects into one of the defined classes. These objects are detected using higher resolution feature maps made possible by recent advances in deep learning with image processing.</p>
